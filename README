Use the normal files, not the .zip ones, as that makes it easier to use :)

npm install bcrypt - Needed for the Registration form

import the7_dump.sql
open myapp in visual studio
open terminal 
run : npm install express 
run : npm run start

click on the localhost link in the terminal / copy and post that link in your browser 
Here is some user's login details (use that password , the passwords are hashed) :
username : User
Password :  Password1! 

Create a ".env" file in your main directory, along with a ".gitignore" (notice there is nothing before the dot, as they are hidden files)
Next run npm install dotenv
In the .gitignore file, add .env so that file is not uploaded to github
In the .env file add:
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=/*password*/ (add your own root password, this won't be uploaded)
DB_DATABASE=the7

For task 7 you can use your own RDBMS (I use DBeaver-CE). Go to the SQL script part and add the SQL query you want to analyze, but add EXPLAIN in front of it, something like:
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM user WHERE username = /*add username here*/;
This will generate a query that says it either needs to go through the entire database (if it is not the primary key). This can be used to see how you can optimise some tables
and/or queries.
